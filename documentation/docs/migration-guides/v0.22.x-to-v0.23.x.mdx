## Offset Paging Strategy [BREAKING CHANGE]

In previous versions of `nestjs-query` the `OFFSET` paging strategy returned an array of nodes, this proved to not be
extensible, especially when wanting to expose other attributes such as `totalCount`, or paging meta such has
`hasNextPage` or `hasPreviousPage`.

In `v0.23.0` the graphql response now returns an `OffsetConnection` that looks like the following

```graphql
type OffsetPageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean
}

type TodoItemConnection {
  pageInfo: OffsetPageInfo!
  nodes: [TodoItem!]!
}

type TodoItem {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  completed: Boolean!
  created: DateTime!
  updated: DateTime!
}
```

## Total Count with OFFSET Strategy

In previous versions of the nestjs-query the `enableTotalCount` option only worked with the `CURSOR` paging strategy.
 In `v0.23.0` the `enableTotalCount` option now also works with the `OFFSET` paging strategy.

 When `enableTotalCount` is set to true the following graphql schema will be generated


```graphql
type OffsetPageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean
}

type TodoItemConnection {
  totalCount: Int!
  pageInfo: OffsetPageInfo!
  nodes: [TodoItem!]!
}

type TodoItem {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  completed: Boolean!
  created: DateTime!
  updated: DateTime!
}
```

## Relation Decorator Changes [BREAKING CHANGE]

In previous versions of `nestjs-query` there were four relation decorators `@Relation`, `@FilterableRelation`,
`@Connection`, and `@FilterableConnection` all four of the decorators have been changed to be more explicit in naming
 to be clear in what they are doing.

In `v0.23.0` the decorators have been renamed to be more explicit.

* `@Relation` - A relation that is a single value (one-to-one, many-to-one)
* `@FilterableRelation` - A `@Relation` that enables filtering the parent by fields of the relation `DTO`.
* `@UnPagedRelation` - An array of relations (e.g, many-to-many, one-to-many) that do not have pagination enabled.
* `@FilterableUnPagedRelation` - An `@UnPagedRelation` that enables filtering the parent by fields of the relation
`DTO`.
* `@OffsetConnection` - A connection that represents a collection (e.g, many-to-many, one-to-many) that uses `offset`
 based pagination.
* `@FilterableOffsetConnection` - An `@OffsetConnection` that enables filtering the parent by fields of the connection
 `DTO`.
* `@CursorConnection` - A connection that represents a collection (e.g, many-to-many, one-to-many) that uses `cursor`
 based pagination.
* `@FilterableCursorConnection` - A `@CursorConnection` that enables filtering the parent by fields of the
 connection `DTO`.

Below is a mapping of the old definition to the new one

:::warning
In previous versions the `OFFSET` paging strategy returned an array of relations, the new version returns an
`OffsetConnection`
:::

```ts
//old
@Relation('subTasks', () => [TodoItem])
//new
@OffsetConnection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```

```ts
//old
@FilterableRelation('subTasks', () => [TodoItem])
//new
@FilterableOffsetConnection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```

```ts
//old
@Relation('subTasks', () => [TodoItem], {pagingStrategy: PagingStrategies.NONE})
//new
@UnPagedRelation('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```

```ts
//old
@FilterableRelation('subTasks', () => [TodoItem], {pagingStrategy: PagingStrategies.NONE})
//new
@FilterableUnPagedRelation('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```

```ts
//old
@Connection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
//new
@CursorConnection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```

```ts
//old
@FilterableConnection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
//new
@FilterableCursorConnection('subTasks', () => TodoItem)
```
