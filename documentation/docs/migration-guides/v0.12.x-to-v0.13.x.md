title: v0.12.x to v0.13.x
---

:::note
This change only affects `@nestjs-query/query-graphql` resolvers. 
:::  


In the `v0.13.x` a new feature was added to `@nestjs-query/query-graphql` to allow for specifying an alternate paging strategy.

To support this change the `Resolver` `queryMany` method was re-named to `queryManyConnection`. The original `queryMethod` will only return an array of results.
