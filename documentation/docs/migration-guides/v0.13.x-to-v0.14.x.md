title: v0.13.x to v0.14.x
---

:::note
This change only affects `@codeshine/nestjs-query-graphql` resolvers.
:::

In the `v0.14.x` the paging/connection portion of the library was re-written to be type safe.

In the previous version a temporary solution was put in place to handle an array or cursor connection differentiating between `queryMany` and `queryManyConnection`.

In `0.14.x` the `queryMany` and `queryManyConnection` are merged into a single method. The `queryMany` method is typesafe and will type check the arguments as well as the return type.
