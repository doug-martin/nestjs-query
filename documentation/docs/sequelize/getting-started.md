title: Getting Started

The `@nestjs-query/query-sequelize` package provides an implementation of `@nestjs-query/core` [QueryService](../concepts/services).

This package is built using [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [@nestjs/sequelize](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#sequelize-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.

## Installation
