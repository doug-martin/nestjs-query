title: Serialization
---

Using `class-transformer` is a popular libarary used in `nestjs`, unfortunately `class-transformer` does not play nicely with `tyepgoose` documents.

For most use cases `nestjs-query` will take care of the serialization for you through [assemblers](../../concepts/advanced/assemblers.mdx). If you find yourself in a situation where you want to use `class-transformer` with a model you should use the following patterns.

To convert your DTO into a model, you can inject your Model and create a new instance.

```ts
new TodoItemModel(todoItemDTO);
```

When converting your entity into a DTO, you can use the following.

```ts
const dto = plainToClass(TodoItemDTO, todoItemEntity.toObject({ virtuals: true }));
```
