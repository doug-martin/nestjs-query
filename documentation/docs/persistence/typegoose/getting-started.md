The `@ptc-org/nestjs-query-typegoose` package provides an implementation of `@ptc-org/nestjs-query-core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [typegoose](https://typegoose.github.io/typegoose/) and [nestjs-typegoose](https://github.com/kpfromer/nestjs-typegoose#readme). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.
