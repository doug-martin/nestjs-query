The `@codeshine/nestjs-query-query-mongoose` package provides an implementation of `@codeshine/nestjs-query-core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [@nestjs/mongoose](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.
