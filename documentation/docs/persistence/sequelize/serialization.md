title: Serialization
---

Using `class-transformer` is a popular libarary used in `nestjs`, unfortunately `class-transformer` does not place nicely with `sequelize` models.

For most use cases `nestjs-query` will take care of the serialization for you through [assemblers](../concepts/assemblers). If you find yourself in a situation where you want to use `class-transformer` with a model you should use the following patterns.


To convert your DTO into a model you can use the `build` method on the model.
```ts
TodoItemEntity.build(todoItemDTO);
```

When converting your entity into a DTO you can use the following.

```ts
const dto = plainToClass(TodoItemDTO, todoItemEntity.get({ plain: true }));
```
