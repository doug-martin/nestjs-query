The `@codeshine/nestjs-query-query-sequelize` package provides an implementation of `@codeshine/nestjs-query-core` [QueryService](../../concepts/services.md).

This package is built using [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [@nestjs/sequelize](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#sequelize-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first.

## Installation

[Installation Docs](../../introduction/install.md#nestjs-queryquery-sequelize)

## Docs

- Read the [QueryService docs](../services.mdx)
- [Custom Service](./custom-service.md)
- [Serialization](./serialization.md) - How to serialize `sequelize` models.
