title: Getting Started

The `@nestjs-query/query-typeorm` package provides an implementation of `@nestjs-query/core` [QueryService](../concepts/services).

This package is built using [typeorm](https://typeorm.io/#/) and [@nestjs/typeorm](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#typeorm-integration). If you are unfamiliar with them I suggest you read their documentation first. 

## Installation
